### 1. What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment means doing or saying anything of a sexual nature that makes someone feel uncomfortable.

- Unwanted physical touch  
- Dirty jokes/comments  
- Sharing offensive content  
- Staring or gestures  
- Repeated unwanted contact  
- Creating fear/discomfort

All these are wrong and not acceptable in a professional place. We should always treat everyone with respect.

### 2. What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

I will ,

- Stay calm and try to think clearly.
- Warning them or giving a chance in polite, that what they are doing is not at all acceptable or correct
- Report the issue to HR or the Internal Committee (IC) as mentioned in the Company PoSH policy.

- If someone else is facing it, I will support them and help them report it.
- Keep everything private and professional, and not gossip about it. 

By taking the right action at the right time, we can make sure our workplace stays safe and respectful for everyone.
