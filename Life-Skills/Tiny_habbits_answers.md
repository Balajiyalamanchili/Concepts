# Key Ideas on Building Better Habits

## 1. Tiny Habits – BJ Fogg
“Don’t try big-big habits. Start very small. Like, after brushing teeth, do just 2 push-ups. That’s enough to start.”  
Start with tiny actions are easier to begin and maintain.


## 2. B = MAP Formula

- **B = Behavior**
- **M = Motivation** -> how much you want to do it
- **A = Ability** -> how easy it is for you
- **P = Prompt** -> reminder

If all three come together, the habit will happen. Simple!



## 3. Why Celebrate ("Shine")

After any small habit, celebrate: smile, say “Yes!”, or give a hi-five.  
This happy feeling helps your brain remember and repeat the habit.


## 4. 1% Better Every Day

Don’t aim for big changes at once.  
Improve just 1% every day. So small steps add up to big results over time.


## 5. Atomic Habits Summary

- **Identity:**  
    Don’t just say “I want to study.” Say “I am a good learner.”  
    If you believe it, you’ll act like it.

- **Make habits easier:**  
    Keep your book ready near your bed.  
    Do a small version of the habit, like 2 minutes of reading.

- **Make bad habits harder:**  
    Try to be busy in your life for other things, or do other activities that you like other than mobile things.  
    Make it tough to access.


## 6. Reflection

**Habit to build:** Practise daily  
- Keep a schedule
- Practise a little every day  
- Enjoy and celebrate after completing

**Habit to stop:** Too much phone use  
- Notice and feel bad when wasting time, so your brain avoids it next time
